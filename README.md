atmo
====

a puzzle that relies on you making atom combinations!

a warning
====

for some reason I decided to make all of the variables one letter long. good thinking finnbar.

requirements
====

requires love 0.9.0, but can run on 0.8.0 if you remove the love.window command and add the following line to the top of the file:
<pre>love.math.random=math.random</pre>

other things
====

OpenSans is not my font.
